<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Nothing, it's free because of our wonderful sponsors and guides! You just need to be excited! And you need to show up ready to learn.</p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
<p>You'll learn designing, prototyping and coding with the help from our friendly coaches.</p>

<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
<p>The workshop is aimed at beginners to programming. Women of any age with basic knowledge of working with a computer are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>If you already program and are curious about Rails feel free to go through <a href="https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/5a26b531e8e47b4aa638">the tutorial
</a> on your own. It is laid out step by step.</p>

<h3>Can men attend?</h3>
<p>Women are given priority, but men are welcome as long as they are accompanied by an interested woman.</p>

<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>Do you know Ruby on Rails? We’re also looking for friendly coaches. Email us at railsgirlsla@gmail.com with the subject line: 
"RG2016 Coach"</p>

<h3>Can men Coach?</h3>
<p>We love cool male coaches. We want to have a mix of male and female coaches.</p>

<h3>What do I need?</h3>
<p>You need your own laptop, curiosity and a sprinkle of imagination!</p>

<h3>I signed up for the event, am I automatically attending?</h3>
<p>No, unfortunately not. Because we can only accept 25 students we want to make sure that all applicants are motivated and committed.</p>
<p>All applicants must finish four short tutorials to be considered.</p>
<p>Most applicants will be accepted when they submit proof of completion of the tutorials.</p>
<p>The tutorials are fun, for beginners and will help you get the most out of the workshop, so don't stress out, <b>it's not a test. You can do it. :)</b></p>
<p>If you are accepted and something happens so that you cannot attend, let us know. We can give the free seat to someone else.</p>
